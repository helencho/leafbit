# Leafbit :seedling:

Buy a seed. Watch your tree grow as you progress towards your activity goals. Plant your tree on the map when the tree reaches its maturity :deciduous_tree:. 

Feel good about partner organizations planting a tree in real life. 

This Fitbit clock face works together with [Leafbit Web App](https://github.com/husheric/LeafbitWeb).
